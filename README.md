Simple Python code for 2d coordinates (Cartesian Coordinates)

This is a simple Python program I made as one of my first projects for my Computer Science major.
It is a 2d coordinate program where the user sets the origin point and then the program tells in which quadrants each point is set.
We were allowed to use only what we learned in the algorithms course up to that point, so vectors and objects were not allowed.
